# *Table Talk: A Bar and Restaurant Management Web Application*

## Abstract

The hospitality industry's ongoing modernization demands innovative solutions to replace traditional management systems that often impede operational efficiency and customer satisfaction. The "Table Talk" project emerges from direct collaboration with hospitality professionals to address sector-specific challenges through a comprehensive bar and restaurant management web application. This initiative focuses on developing an intuitive and flexible system that optimizes workflow for establishments while simultaneously enhancing experience for both staff and customers. By employing a microservices architecture, the application was built using React with TypeScript for the frontend and Spring Boot for the backend, with PostgreSQL handling data managementâ€”all containerized with Docker for seamless deployment. The system's centerpiece is an interactive, customizable table map that visually represents the establishment's layout, facilitating spatial organization of orders and service. Additional core functionalities include an intuitive order-taking system with real-time synchronization through WebSockets technology, and a robust product and menu management system that allows for creating and modifying offerings without compromising existing data. The development methodology prioritized user experience through iterative design informed by industry feedback, resulting in role-specific interfaces that accommodate different operational needs. Implementation results demonstrate significant improvements in order processing speed, reduced service errors, and enhanced coordination between front-of-house and kitchen staff. This project illustrates how targeted technological intervention, developed in close partnership with industry stakeholders, can effectively modernize hospitality operations while maintaining accessibility for users with varying technical expertise.
